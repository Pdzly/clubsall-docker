# Sublinks Docker

This repo will hold docker-compose.yml files to run Sublinks for both demo and local dev purposes

CURRENT STATUS: Please note, this repo currently holds configuration files intended for development purposes only. As we get closer to our initial MVP release we will provide sample files for use in a live site.

## Demo Site

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up [-d]`

## Frontend Dev

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.frontend.yml up [-d]`

## Backend Dev

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.backend.yml up [-d]`

## Federation Dev

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.federation.yml up [-d]`
